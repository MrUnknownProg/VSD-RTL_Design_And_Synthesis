# VSD-RTL_Design_And_Synthesis
## Overview
This repository contains RTL design and synthesis projects developed using open-source tools including Icarus Verilog (iverilog), Yosys, and GTKWave within a cloud-based lab environment. The development and verification flow is managed on GitHub Codespaces, allowing easy cloud access with no local setup required.​ 

## Features
- RTL design and verification using Verilog
- Synthesis with Yosys open-source FPGA toolchain
- Simulation via Icarus Verilog
- Waveform viewing using GTKWave
- Fully cloud-enabled workflow with GitHub Codespaces and noVNC desktop access​ 

## Cloud Lab Setup
Leverages the [vsdip/vsd-rtl](https://github.com/vsdip/vsd-rtl) environment to run all tools and handle synthesis seamlessly inside a containerized workspace in the cloud.​
