# VSD-RTL_Design_And_Synthesis
## Verilog Simulation and Synthesis Flow

This repository contains basic Verilog experiments demonstrating how to:
- Simulate RTL using Icarus Verilog
- View waveforms using GTKWave
- Synthesize RTL to a gate‑level netlist using Yosys

The sections below explain what each tool does and show the exact commands used.

## 1. Icarus Verilog

Icarus Verilog is a free, open‑source Verilog simulator and compiler. It takes your RTL design and testbench, compiles them, and lets you run simulations so you can verify how your digital circuit behaves and generate waveforms.

### 1.1 Compile RTL and testbench

This command compiles the RTL file and the testbench into a single simulation executable.

```bash
iverilog rtl_file.v tb_file.v
```


- `rtl_file.v`  → your Verilog design (RTL)
- `tb_file.v`   → your testbench that applies inputs and checks outputs

### 1.2 Run the simulation

After compilation, run the generated executable to perform the simulation.

```bash
./a.out
```

- Executes the testbench and design together  
- If the testbench uses `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars`, this command creates a VCD waveform file

### 1.3 VCD waveform file

The simulation produces a Value Change Dump (VCD) file that records how every signal changes over time.

```bash
tb_file.vcd
```

You will open this file in GTKWave to inspect signal activity.

## 2. GTKWave

GTKWave is a waveform viewer for digital simulations. It opens the `.vcd` file generated by Icarus Verilog and displays signal transitions over time, which helps you debug timing, glitches, and logical behavior.

### 2.1 Open the waveform

Use this command to view the simulation results.

```bash
gtkwave tb_file.vcd
```

- Loads `tb_file.vcd` into GTKWave  
- You can then add signals to the waveform window, zoom in/out, and inspect timing relationships

## 3. Yosys

Yosys (Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite) is an open‑source logic synthesis tool for Verilog. It reads your RTL, uses a standard‑cell library, optimizes the logic, maps it to real cells, and can both show a schematic and write out a clean gate‑level netlist.

### 3.1 Start Yosys

Launch the Yosys interactive shell:

```bash
yosys
```

All the following commands are typed at the Yosys prompt.

### 3.2 Read the Verilog design

Load your RTL Verilog file into Yosys:

```bash
read_verilog rtl_file.v
```

- Tells Yosys which modules and logic it needs to synthesize

### 3.3 Load the Liberty library

Read the standard‑cell library (.lib) for your technology/PDK:

```bash
read_liberty -lib /path/to/libPDK_file.lib
```

- Provides information about available cells (NAND, NOR, flip‑flops, etc.)  
- Includes timing, area, and power data used during synthesis

### 3.4 Run synthesis

Run the main synthesis step and set your top module:

```bash
synth -top rtl_file
```

- `rtl_file` here is the name of the top module (not the filename extension)  
- Converts your RTL into an optimized generic gate‑level netlist

### 3.5 Technology mapping and optimization

Map the generic netlist onto cells from the Liberty library and further optimize it:

```bash
abc -liberty /path/to/libPDK_file.lib
```

- Uses the ABC engine for technology mapping  
- Improves timing and area based on the chosen library

### 3.6 Display schematic

Generate and display a schematic of the synthesized design:

```bash
show
```

- Opens a graphical view of the synthesized logic  
- Useful to quickly verify the implemented structure

### 3.7 Write the synthesized netlist

Export the synthesized design to a Verilog netlist file:

```bash
write_verilog -noattr rtl_file_netlist.v
```

- `rtl_file_netlist.v` is a customizable file name where the netlist will be saved  
- `-noattr` removes tool‑specific attributes and extra annotations so the output Verilog is cleaner and easier to read

## 4. Typical Flow Summary

1. Write `rtl_file.v` and `tb_file.v`.  
2. Simulate with Icarus Verilog:  
   - `iverilog rtl_file.v tb_file.v`  
   - `./a.out` → generates `tb_file.vcd`  
3. View waveforms in GTKWave:  
   - `gtkwave tb_file.vcd`  
4. Synthesize with Yosys:  
   - `yosys`  
   - `read_verilog rtl_file.v`  
   - `read_liberty -lib /path/to/libPDK_file.lib`  
   - `synth -top rtl_file`  
   - `abc -liberty /path/to/libPDK_file.lib`  
   - `show`  
   - `write_verilog -noattr rtl_file_netlist.v`
